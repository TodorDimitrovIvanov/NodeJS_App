REFACTORING

CONTRIBUTING
- Use the GitHib Issue Tracker exclusively for Bugs, Feature requests and Questions
- DON'T ASK to create examples/code for you, read [docs] and [API] first, then you can post
  what you have tried (your code) and what you're unable to achieve
Wrong question "Can you show me a code"

TODOS:
- Commands (TESTS)
- StyleManager (Tests)
- BlockView (Tests)
- RTE (after traits)
  - API Reference
  - Tests
- Render model attributes to HTML (editor.getConfg().modelAttrbites) and inside each component
  I could define an array of possible attributes to render. (model.attrsToRender: 'a,b,c')
- When using props like margin inside SM, I'd like to see margin-top, margin-left, to update too...
  I could use some extra property when it's activated, will fetch also computedStyle (which is somehow slow)

- Mobile first approach
  general rules with no media query (smallest)
  min-width: 320{}
  min-width: 768{}
  min-width: 1024{}

  mobileFirst: 1 // 'min-width'
  Desktop - width:'', widthMedia:'1024',
  Tablet - width:'768', widthMedia:'768',
  Mobile - width: '320', widthMedia: '',

HOW-TO
 - How to implement IndexedDB inside storage manager (better localForage)
  (If you'd like to know how to implement some other storage services check the tutorial on How to integrate IndexedDB)
   Tutorials: Use IndexedDB as local storage, for unlimited storage
   The main purpose of this guide is not to show the best tecnology to use, also because I'd have suggested
   to use something like localForage which seems to be more reliable solution

GrapesJS is a powerful visual web tool for building any king of templates without coding.

The project focuses mainly on providing tools for building any kind of templates, easily and without any knowledgemnt in coding. An other important goal is also to make these tools easily extendible by other developers which could create specific editors, which will allow users to customize their sites, ecommerce shops, mobile applications, newsletter and much more with only dragging and styling (one-page-site-like demo here). It's also possible to create things that could be generated from the HTML, like documents, business cards or invoices, just to mention some of them.

The core of GrapesJS is designed to be lightweight and is composed by the essential sets of components, blocks and commands, but it easily extendible with plugins (with help of its APIs) in the way to guarantee the maximum flexibility and integrability with other softwares.

The project is still in alpha and unfortunately the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features, in reasonable time, became pretty unsustainable for only one person. Even being an open source project (here the page on Github) it's not easy to find someone willing to work with you free, so for this reason I opened this campaign, to form a team of developers which, I really hope, will help me to bring this project further.

* Various demo/tutorial implementations
* Good documentation (pretty much hard step)

I'll form a small team of developers to work on GrapesJS fulltime if this goal is met


## Hey 5.500$/month it's a lot of money, how do you expect to spend them?
Unfortunately there is a lot of work to do and I can't do it alone, so I'll spend all of those to build a team, if possible full-time devs but any option will be evaluated. If you're a developer, please send me your resume and in case this campaign will be successful I'll know where to start looking.

Pricing
- About the pricing, you pay for each page? I need to pay before make it public?!? or it's a one-shot, for example, 10 pages?

Next features
- Prepopulating landing page fields
- Leads backup
- Lead notifications
- Dynamic text replacement (instapage has this feature) - variables?
- Ability to switch templates while keeping copy unchanged

General
- I'll be the only one involved in this new app or I need someone else?
- I dont know your tecnology stack, so do you have some preferences on front-end framework? React, VueJs, Angular?!?
- Do you have web designers? I'm not a web designer but I can definitely provide you with some good looking design
- Domain acquisition is also managed by you or it's the customer's task?
- About the domain management, what web server do you use? Apache, nginx? Do you have already something to manage vhosts?
